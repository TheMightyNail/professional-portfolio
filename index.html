            <p>
                Hello, and thank you for taking the time to visit my page and portfolio! I am a (soon to be) web developer and currently have skills in HTML and CSS. Below, you'll find examples of work I've done. I'm currently learning JavaScript and will be learning many other programming languages as well. Technology is a constantly evolving medium and it takes a firm understanding of, not only the languages used for programming, but the resources to learn how to adapt in such an ever shifting environment. I think this is what makes me an ideal candidate to work on YOUR next project! I learn quickly and efficiently and can promise to deliver the things you need! Outside of work, I am passionate about art and am never not working on something! Whether it's a drawing, writing, or livestreaming on Twitch in my freetime. I believe a creative mind is a happy mind!
            </p>
